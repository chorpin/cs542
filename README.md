This is a new and creative application of convolutional neural networks. After Isotope labelling, we can get a picture of the genes
As we known, there are two kinds of phases included in genes, lambda phase and T7 phase. The pattern on the different genes is not same. Just by the human eye's , we cannot tell the different clearly, so I use the cnn to do a claffication of genes
